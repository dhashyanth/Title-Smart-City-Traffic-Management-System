# Title-Smart-City-Traffic-Management-System
The Smart City Traffic Management System aims to enhance the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of urban transportation networks by leveraging real-time data on traffic density and prioritizing vehicles based on their importance and urgency. This project description outlines the key components and functionalities of the proposed system.
Objectives:
a. To develop an intelligent traffic management system that dynamically monitors and analyzes traffic density in real-time.
b. To prioritize vehicles based on predefined criteria, such as emergency services, public transportation, and high-occupancy vehicles.
c. To optimize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and reduce travel times for all road users.
