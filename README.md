# Smart-City-Traffic-Management-System
The Smart City Traffic Management System aims to enhance the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of urban transportation networks by leveraging real-time data on traffic density and prioritizing vehicles based on their importance and urgency. This project description outlines the key components and functionalities of the proposed system.
Objectives is to develop an intelligent traffic management system that dynamically monitors and analyzes traffic density in real-time, to prioritize vehicles based on predefined criteria, such as emergency services, public transportation, and high-occupancy vehicles and to optimize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and reduce travel times for all road users.
